|Background|InsightCrew, a leading technology firm, was facing challenges in managing its growing workforce efficiently. With over 100 employees spread across various departments, keeping track of employee information, attendance, leaves, and performance evaluations had become increasingly complex. The HR department, led by Miss Jane Doe, realized the need for a centralized system to streamline these processes and improve overall operational efficiency.|
|The SQL Solution|To address these challenges, I leveraged the power of SQL to implement the Employee Management System (EMS). SQL provided the robust database management capabilities needed to handle the large volume of employee data and streamline HR operations. The EMS was customized to meet InsightCrew's specific requirements and integrated seamlessly with their existing systems. The system included modules for employee information management, attendance tracking, leave management, and performance evaluation.|

Below are some sample queries that were used to extract insights from the data using SQL. The first query is answered while the other queries are answered using SQL in the SQL script attached to this folder.
